  /**
   * @c open starts one or more asynchronous accept requests on a
   * @a address. Each accept operation may optionally read an
   * initial buffer from the new connection when accepted.
   *
   * @param address The address to listen/accept connections on.
   *                If the address does not specify a port, a random
   *                port is selected and bound.
   * @param bytes_to_read Optional, specifies the maximum number of bytes
   *                to read with the accept. The buffer for the initial
   *                data is allocated internally and passed to the
   *                @c TRB_Service_Handler::open() hook method. It is
   *                legitimate only during the @c open() method and must
   *                be copied if required after @c open() returns.
   *                This pre-read function works only on Windows.
   * @param pass_addresses Optional, a non-zero value indicates that
   *                the local and peer addresses should be passed to the
   *                associated @c TRB_Service_Handler::addresses() method
   *                after any call to @c validate_new_connection() and prior
   *                to the @c open() hook method call.
   * @param backlog Optional, defaulting to @c ACE_DEFAULT_BACKLOG (which
   *                can be adjusted in your platform's @c config.h file).
   *                Specifies the listening backlog for the listening socket.
   * @param reuse_addr Optional, indicates whether the @c SO_REUSEADDR
   *                option is set on the listening socket or not.
   * @param proactor Optional, pointer to the @c TRB_Proactor to use for
   *                demultiplexing asynchronous accepts. If 0, the
   *                process's singleton @c TRB_Proactor is used.
   * @param validate_new_connection Optional, if non-zero, this object's
   *                @c validate_connection() method is called after
   *                the accept completes, but before the service handler's
   *                @c open() hook method is called. If @c
   *                validate_connection() returns -1, the newly-accepted
   *                socket is immediately closed, and the @c addresses()
   *                method is not called.
   * @param reissue_accept Optional, if non-zero (the default), a new
   *                asynchronous accept operation is started after each
   *                completion, whether the completion is for success or
   *                failure, and whether or not a successfully-accepted
   *                connection is subsequently refused.
   * @param number_of_initial_accepts Optional, the number of asynchronous
   *                accepts that are started immediately. If -1 (the
   *                default), the value of @a backlog is used.
   *
   * @note On Windows, the peer address is only available at the time
   *       the connection is accepted.  Therefore, if you require the peer
   *       address on Windows, do not rely on the
   *       @c ACE_SOCK::get_remote_addr() method - it won't work. You must
   *       supply a non-zero value for @a pass_addresses and obtain the
   *       peer address in the @c TRB_Service_Handler::addresses() method.
   *
